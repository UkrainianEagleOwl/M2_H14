# REST API Documentation and Testing

## Overview
This project extends the REST API from Homework 13 by adding detailed Sphinx documentation and covering the codebase with both unit and functional tests. The project employs Unittest for module testing and Pytest for functional testing of API routes.

## Features
- **Sphinx Documentation**:
  - Detailed documentation for the API created using Sphinx.
  - Docstrings added to functions and class methods for better clarity.
- **Unittest Framework**:
  - Comprehensive unit tests for repository modules.
- **Pytest Framework**:
  - Functional tests for selected API routes.

## Technical Details
- **Sphinx Documentation Setup**:
  - Installation and configuration of Sphinx for generating project documentation.
  - Addition of docstrings in the codebase following standard conventions.
- **Unittest Implementation**:
  - Creation of unit tests to cover various modules and functionalities.
- **Pytest for Functional Testing**:
  - Writing functional tests for at least one API route to ensure correct behavior.

## Usage
- **Generating Documentation**:
  - Run Sphinx commands to generate HTML documentation from the source code.
- **Running Tests**:
  - Execute unit tests using the Unittest framework.
  - Execute functional tests using Pytest.

## Installation and Dependencies
- Clone the repository.
- Requires Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pytest, Unittest, Sphinx, and other related libraries.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed for Sphinx documentation and testing frameworks.
